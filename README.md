# Blockchain19
This project is implement a blockchain system that will decentralize and help track the integrity and process of the COVID19 vaccine.

## Project Mission / Motiviation

There is limited visibility within the medical supply chain when it comes to receiving medications or vaccinations. From manufacturers, logistics, hospitals/clinics, and recipients there is a lack of transparency with the process that causes errors, waste of resources (money and time), and are more susceptible to data breaches.
Eliminating indecisiveness.  

## Project Objective
We will work with Jonathan and Matt from the DMDC to make a program that will track and verify the status and process of a COVID-19 vaccination in a decentralized manner utilizing some form of Blockchain by the end of this semester. 

## Project Approach
- We would need to do research on the process of a COVID-19 vaccination from start to finish. Then decide on which portion of that supply chain we wish to implement the blockchain technology to.
- Afterwards we will apply the agile development and create user stories. This will help divide up the work of the project. 
- For this project we will be using Java. Our team is most familiar with Java. Since blockchain is a new concept for all of us, we decided to choose a language that we would not struggle with. 
- We will also be using Google cloud platform. Using a platform is common in the industry and we wanted to apply this to our project. 

## Dependencies / Risks
- Dependencies: 
    - The usage of SHA-256, RSA encryption scheme
    - Understanding the blockchain model.
    - Learning and refreshing on java and the Google cloud platform we would be using.
- Risk: 
    - Blockchain not working as expected, or potentially less efficient than existing databases and tracking methods.

## Project Deliverables
- Blockchain-powered tracker for supply chain management
- A document comparing the performance of blockchain compared to other databases
